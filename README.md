# React useEffect Hook with Missing Dependencies
This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: the omission of necessary dependencies in the dependency array. This oversight can lead to unexpected behavior, including infinite loops, incorrect state updates, and performance issues.

## Problem
The provided `MyComponent` uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from an API and update the component's state. However, the dependency array `[]` is empty. This means that the effect runs only once after the initial render. Subsequent state updates caused by fetching data will not trigger a re-render and this creates an infinite loop.

## Solution
The solution involves correctly specifying the dependencies in the `useEffect` hook's dependency array. In this case, the `setCount` function is added to the dependency array, which ensures that the effect runs only when the `setCount` function changes. To resolve this we use the `count` variable in the dependency array to avoid unnecessary re-renders
